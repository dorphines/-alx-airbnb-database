Overview
This project focuses on setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Django-based messaging application. The pipeline includes:
- Jenkins for automated testing, Docker image building, and pushing to Docker Hub.
- GitHub Actions for running tests, linting checks, code coverage, and Docker image deployment.
- Docker for containerizing the Django application.

The goal is to automate testing, ensure code quality, and streamline deployment processes.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn how to:
1. Set up Jenkins in Docker and configure a pipeline for automated testing and Docker builds.
2. Integrate GitHub Actions to run tests, linting, and code coverage checks.
3. Build and push Docker images using both Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
4. Secure sensitive credentials (GitHub, Docker Hub) using Jenkins credentials and GitHub Secrets.
5. Automate workflows to trigger on code pushes and pull requests.

Key Concepts
Continuous Integration (CI) – Automatically running tests and checks on every code change.
Continuous Deployment (CD) – Automating Docker image builds and deployments.
Containerization – Using Docker to package the application for consistent deployment.
Pipeline as Code – Defining Jenkins and GitHub Actions workflows in YAML/Jenkinsfile.
Code Quality & Testing – Using pytest, flake8, and coverage reports.
Tools & Libraries
Category	Tools/Libraries
CI/CD	Jenkins, GitHub Actions
Testing	pytest, Coverage
Linting	flake8
Containerization	Docker, Docker Hub
Version Control	GitHub
Database	MySQL (for testing)
Real-World Use Case
This setup mirrors real-world DevOps workflows where:
✔ Developers push code → Automated tests run → Code quality is checked → Docker image is built & deployed.
✔ Teams ensure stability before merging changes.
✔ Deployments become faster and more reliable using containerization.

This project helps in understanding CI/CD best practices, which are widely used in startups and large-scale applications to maintain high-quality software delivery.

Next Steps
Extend the pipeline with Kubernetes deployment.
Add security scanning (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).
Implement rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.

Tasks
0. Install Jenkins and Set Up a Pipeline:
mandatory
Objective: install Jenkins in a docker container and set up a pipeline that pulls the source code from GitHub, runs tests using pytest, generates a test report, and triggers the pipeline manually.

*Instructions: *

Run jenkins in a docker container by executing the following command
docker run -d --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v 
jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
This command will:

Pull the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) Jenkins image.
Expose Jenkins on port 8080.
Map the Jenkins home directory to the host machine to persist data.
Access Jenkins dashboard by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser and follow the instructions to set up and configure Jenkins

Install the git plugin, Pipeline and ShiningPandaPlugin. Hint

Create a Jenkinsfile pipeline script that pulls the messaging app’s code from GitHub, installs dependencies, runs tests using pytest, and generates a report

Ensure to add Credentials for GitHub

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/Jenkinsfile
1. Build Docker image with Jenkins
mandatory
Objective: building a Docker image for your Django messaging app using Jenkins

Instructions:

Extend the Jenkins Pipeline Script Jenkinsfile to add stages for building and pushing the Docker image

After updating the Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository, go to the Jenkins dashboard and trigger the pipeline manually by clicking on Build Now.

Monitor the build logs to verify that the Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub successfully.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/Jenkinsfile
2. Set Up a GitHub Actions Workflow for Testing
mandatory
Objective: Set up github actions for Testing

Instructions:

Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file in your messaging app’s repository.

Configure a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the Django tests on every push and pull request.

Ensure the workflow installs necessary dependencies and sets up a MySQL database for running tests (e.g., using services in GitHub Actions).

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/.github/workflows/ci.yml
3. Code Quality Checks in GitHub Actions:
mandatory
Objective: Run Code Quality Checks in GitHub Actions

*Instructions: *

Extend your GitHub Actions workflow to include a flake8 check for linting the Django project.

Fail the build if any linting errors are detected.

Add a step to generate code coverage reports and upload them as build artifacts.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/.github/workflows/ci.yml
4. Docker Image and github actions
mandatory
Objective: Build and Push Docker Image using GitHub Actions

Instructions:

In dep.yaml file, Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a Docker image for the messaging app.

Push the Docker image to Docker Hub

Use GitHub Actions’ secrets feature to store your Docker credentials securely

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/.github/workflows/dep.yml
5. Manual Review
mandatory
