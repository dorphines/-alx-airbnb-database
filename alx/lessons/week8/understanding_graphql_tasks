Overview
GraphQL is a powerful query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook, that allows clients to request exactly the data they need — nothing more, nothing less. Unlike REST APIs, which return fixed data structures, GraphQL gives clients the flexibility to shape the response format.

We will explore the foundations of GraphQL, understand its advantages over REST, and learn how to implement GraphQL in Django using libraries like graphene-django.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

Explain what GraphQL is and how it differs from REST.
Describe the key components of a GraphQL schema (types, queries, mutations).
Set up and configure GraphQL in a Django project using graphene-django.
Build GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and manipulate data.
Use tools like GraphiQL or Insomnia to interact with GraphQL endpoints.
Follow best practices to design scalable and secure GraphQL APIs.
Learning Outcomes
After completing this lesson, learners should be able to:

Implement GraphQL APIs in Django applications.
Write custom queries and mutations using graphene.
Integrate Django models into GraphQL schemas.
Optimize performance and security in GraphQL endpoints.
Explain when to use GraphQL instead of REST in real-world projects.
Key Concepts
GraphQL vs REST: Unlike REST which has multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all operations.
Schema: Defines how clients can access the data. Includes Types, Queries, and Mutations.
Resolvers: Functions that fetch data for a particular query or mutation.
Graphene-Django: A Python library that integrates GraphQL into Django seamlessly.
Best Practices for Using GraphQL with Django
Area	Best Practice
Schema Design	Keep schema clean and modular. Define reusable types and use clear naming.
Security	Implement authentication and authorization in resolvers. Avoid exposing all data.
Error Handling	Use custom error messages and handle exceptions gracefully in resolvers.
Pagination	Implement pagination on large query sets to improve performance.
N+1 Problem	Use tools like DjangoSelectRelatedField or graphene-django-optimizer
Testing	Write unit tests for your queries and mutations to ensure correctness.
Documentation	Use GraphiQL for automatic schema documentation and make it available to clients.
Tools & Libraries
graphene-django: Main library to integrate GraphQL in Django
GraphiQL: Browser-based UI for testing GraphQL APIs
Django ORM: Connect your models directly to GraphQL types
Insomnia/Postman: Useful for testing APIs including GraphQL
Real-World Use Cases
Airbnb-style applications with flexible data querying
Dashboards that need precise, real-time data
Mobile apps with limited bandwidth and specific data needs
Tasks
0. Set Up GraphQL Endpoint
mandatory
Objective
Set up a GraphQL endpoint and define your first schema and query.

Instructions
Create Project and App

Set up a new Django project called alx-backend-graphql_crm.
Create an app named crm as the main app.
Install Required Libraries

Install graphene-django and django-filters using pip:

 pip install graphene-django django-filter
Define GraphQL Schema

In alx_backend_graphql_crm/schema.py, define a Query class that inherits from graphene.ObjectType.
Inside it, declare a single field:

Name: hello
Type: String
It should return a default value of "Hello, GraphQL!" when queried.
Connect the GraphQL Endpoint

In urls.py, connect the GraphQL endpoint using:

 from django.urls import path
 from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView
 from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

 urlpatterns = [
     path("graphql", csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True))),
 ]
Checkpoint
Visit: http://localhost:8000/graphql
Run the following query:

{
  hello
}

1. Task 1: Build and Seed a CRM Database with GraphQL Integration
mandatory
Objective
Enhance the CRM system by adding GraphQL mutations to create Customer, Product, and Order instances. This includes:

Bulk customer creation
Nested order creation with product associations
Robust validation and error handling
Instructions
1. Define the Mutations
In crm/schema.py, create the following mutation classes:

CreateCustomer
Inputs:
name (required, string)
email (required, unique email)
phone (optional, string)
Validations:
Ensure email is unique.
Validate phone format (e.g., +1234567890 or 123-456-7890).
Behavior:
Saves the customer to the database.
Returns the created customer object and a success message.
Think: How will you handle validation errors (e.g., duplicate email)?
BulkCreateCustomers
Inputs:
A list of customers, each with name, email, and optional phone.
Behavior:
Validates each customer’s data.
Creates customers in a single transaction.
Returns:
List of successfully created customers.
List of errors for failed records.
Challenge: Support partial success — create valid entries even if some fail.
CreateProduct
Inputs:
name (required, string)
price (required, positive decimal)
stock (optional, non-negative integer, default: 0)
Validations:
Ensure price is positive and stock is not negative.
Behavior:
Saves the product to the database.
Returns the created product object.
CreateOrder
Inputs:
customer_id (required, existing customer ID)
product_ids (required, list of existing product IDs)
order_date (optional, defaults to now)
Validations:
Ensure customer and product IDs are valid.
Ensure at least one product is selected.
Behavior:
Creates an order.
Associates specified products.
Calculates total_amount as the sum of product prices.
Returns the created order object with nested customer and product data.
Think: How will you ensure the total_amount is accurate?
Challenge: Implement custom error handling with user-friendly messages (e.g., “Email already exists”, “Invalid product ID”).
2. Add Mutations to the Schema
In crm/schema.py:

Define a Mutation class.
Add mutation fields:
class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    create_customer = CreateCustomer.Field()
    bulk_create_customers = BulkCreateCustomers.Field()
    create_product = CreateProduct.Field()
    create_order = CreateOrder.Field()
Hint: Use Graphene’s Field and List types appropriately.
3. Integrate Into Main Schema
In graphql_crm/schema.py:

Import Query and Mutation from crm.schema.
Combine them:
import graphene
from crm.schema import Query as CRMQuery, Mutation as CRMMutation

class Query(CRMQuery, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass

class Mutation(CRMMutation, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)
Think: Ensure support for nested objects and graceful error handling.
Checkpoint: Test Mutations at /graphql
# Create a single customer
mutation {
  createCustomer(input: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    phone: "+1234567890"
  }) {
    customer {
      id
      name
      email
      phone
    }
    message
  }
}

# Bulk create customers
mutation {
  bulkCreateCustomers(input: [
    { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", phone: "123-456-7890" },
    { name: "Carol", email: "carol@example.com" }
  ]) {
    customers {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    errors
  }
}

# Create a product
mutation {
  createProduct(input: {
    name: "Laptop",
    price: 999.99,
    stock: 10
  }) {
    product {
      id
      name
      price
      stock
    }
  }
}

# Create an order with products
mutation {
  createOrder(input: {
    customerId: "1",
    productIds: ["1", "2"]
  }) {
    order {
      id
      customer {
        name
      }
      products {
        name
        price
      }
      totalAmount
      orderDate
    }
  }

2. Task 2: Implement Complex GraphQL Mutations for CRM
mandatory
Objective:
Enhance the CRM system by adding GraphQL mutations to create Customer, Product, and Order instances, including bulk customer creation and nested order creation with product associations, with robust validation and error handling.

Instructions
Define the Mutations

In crm/schema.py, create the following mutation classes:
CreateCustomer
Takes name (required, string), email (required, unique email), and phone (optional, string) as inputs.
Validates that the email is unique and the phone number (if provided) matches a valid format (e.g., +1234567890 or 123-456-7890).
Saves the new customer to the database.
Returns the created customer object and a success message.
Think: How will you handle validation errors (e.g., duplicate email)?
BulkCreateCustomers
Takes a list of customer inputs, each containing name, email, and optional phone.
Validates each customer’s data and creates them in a single transaction.
Returns a list of created customers and any errors for failed creations.
Challenge: Ensure partial success (valid customers are created even if some fail).
CreateProduct
Takes name (required, string), price (required, positive decimal), and stock (optional, positive integer, default 0).
Validates that the price is positive and the stock is non-negative.
Saves the new product to the database.
Returns the created product object.
CreateOrder
Takes customer_id (required, ID of an existing customer), product_ids (required, list of product IDs), and optional order_date (defaults to now).
Validates that the customer and products exist and that at least one product is provided.
Creates an order, associates the specified products, and calculates total_amount as the sum of product prices.
Returns the created order object, including nested customer and product details.
Think: How will you ensure the total_amount is accurate and consistent?
Challenge: Implement custom error handling for all mutations, returning user-friendly error messages (e.g., “Email already exists” or “Invalid product ID”).
Add Mutations to the Schema

In crm/schema.py, define a Mutation class.
Add fields for each mutation:
create_customer: Calls CreateCustomer.
bulk_create_customers: Calls BulkCreateCustomers.
create_product: Calls CreateProduct.
create_order: Calls CreateOrder.
Hint: Use Graphene’s Field and List types appropriately for input and output.
Integrate Into Main Schema

In graphql_crm/schema.py:
Import Query and Mutation from crm.schema.
Combine them into the project’s main schema to support both queries and mutations.
Think: How will you ensure the schema handles nested objects and errors gracefully?
Checkpoint

Run the following GraphQL mutations at /graphql to verify your setup:
   # Create a single customer
   mutation {
     createCustomer(input: { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", phone: "+1234567890" }) {
       customer {
         id
         name
         email
         phone
       }
       message
     }
   }

   # Bulk create customers
   mutation {
     bulkCreateCustomers(input: [
       { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", phone: "123-456-7890" },
       { name: "Carol", email: "carol@example.com" }
     ]) {
       customers {
         id
         name
         email
       }
       errors
     }
   }

   # Create a product
   mutation {
     createProduct(input: { name: "Laptop", price: 999.99, stock: 10 }) {
       product {
         id
         name
         price
         stock
       }
     }
   }

   # Create an order with products
   mutation {
     createOrder(input: { customerId: "1", productIds: ["1", "2"] }) {
       order {
         id
         customer {
           name
         }
         products {
           name
           price
         }
         totalAmount
         orderDate
       }
     }
   }

3. Task 3: Add Filtering
mandatory
Objective:
Allow users to search for customers using filters such as emails or names

Instructions
Ensure django-filter is Installed

Confirm that django-filter is installed (previously done with pip install django-filter).
Add 'django_filters' to INSTALLED_APPS in your Django settings if not already present.
Create Custom Filter Classes

In a new file crm/filters.py, define the following filter classes using django-filter:
CustomerFilter: - name: Case-insensitive partial match (using icontains). - email: Case-insensitive partial match (using icontains). - created_at: Date range filter (e.g., created_at__gte and created_at__lte). - Challenge: Add a custom filter to match customers with a specific phone number pattern (e.g., starts with +1).

ProductFilter: - name: Case-insensitive partial match. - price: Range filter (e.g., price__gte, price__lte). - stock: Exact match or range filter (e.g., stock__gte, stock__lte). - Think: How can you filter products with low stock (e.g., stock < 10)?

OrderFilter: - total_amount: Range filter (e.g., total_amount__gte, total_amount__lte). - order_date: Date range filter. - customer_name: Filter orders by customer’s name (case-insensitive partial match, using related field lookup). - product_name: Filter orders by product’s name (case-insensitive partial match, using related field lookup). - Challenge: Allow filtering orders that include a specific product ID.

Hint: Use django-filter’s FilterSet class and define Meta classes to specify the model and fields.
Integrate Filters with GraphQL

In crm/schema.py, update the GraphQL Query class to support filtered queries:
all_customers: Accepts filter arguments for name, email, created_at__gte, created_at__lte, and phone_pattern.
all_products: Accepts filter arguments for name, price__gte, price__lte, stock__gte, and stock__lte.
all_orders: Accepts filter arguments for total_amount__gte, total_amount__lte, order_date__gte, order_date__lte, customer_name, and product_name.
Challenge: Add an order_by argument to sort results (e.g., by name, price, or order_date in ascending/descending order).
Use Graphene-Django’s DjangoFilterConnectionField to integrate the filter classes with GraphQL.
Define custom input types (e.g., using graphene.InputObjectType) for complex filters like date ranges or related field lookups.
Think: How will you handle nested filters for related models (e.g., filtering orders by customer name)?
Update the Schema

Ensure the Query class in crm/schema.py is updated to include the filtered fields.
In graphql_crm/schema.py, verify that the main schema includes the updated Query class from crm.schema.
Hint: Test the schema to ensure filters and sorting work correctly.
Checkpoint

Run the following GraphQL queries at /graphql to verify your filtering setup:
   # Filter customers by name and creation date
   query {
     allCustomers(filter: { nameIcontains: "Ali", createdAtGte: "2025-01-01" }) {
       edges {
         node {
           id
           name
           email
           createdAt
         }
       }
     }
   }

   # Filter products by price range and sort by stock
   query {
     allProducts(filter: { priceGte: 100, priceLte: 1000 }, orderBy: "-stock") {
       edges {
         node {
           id
           name
           price
           stock
         }
       }
     }
   }

   # Filter orders by customer name, product name, and total amount
   query {
     allOrders(filter: { customerName: "Alice", productName: "Laptop", totalAmountGte: 500 }) {
       edges {
         node {
           id
           customer {
             name
           }
           product {
             name
           }

           orderDate
         }
       }
     }
